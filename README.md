# Social-Distancing-Awareness-AI
The purpose of my project is to determine whether people in public places are socially distanced using face recognition. Not only will I be able to calculate whether people are 6 ft apart from each other, I will webscrape live covid data in the city of the webcam to create a risk score (i.e. how likely covid will spread) for the people in that location.
